## `(<content_dir> [<~project handle>])-><project handle>` 
##
## opens the specified project by setting default values for the existing or new project handle and setting its content_dir property to the fully qualified path specified.
## if no project handle was given a new one is created.
## if the state of the project handle is `unknown` it was never opened before. It is first transitioned to `closed` after emitting the `project_on_new` event.
## then the project handle is transitioned from `closed` to `open` first the `project_on_opening` event is emitted followed by `project_on_open`.  Afterwards the state is changed to `open` and then the `project_on_opened` event us emitted.  
## returns the project handle of the project on success. fails if the project handle is in a state other than `unknown` or `closed`. 
## 
## *note* that the default project does not contain a package source. it will have to be configured once manually for every new project

## **events**
##  * `project_on_new(<project handle>)`
##  * `project_on_opening(<project handle>)`

## **assumes** 
## * `project_handle.project_descriptor.state` is either `unknown`(null) or `closed`
## 
## **ensures**
## * `content_dir` is set to the absolute path of the project
## * `project_descriptor.state` is set to `open`
