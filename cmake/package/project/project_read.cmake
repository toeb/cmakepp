## `(<package handle> | <project dir> | <project file>)-><project handle>`
## 
##  Opens a project at `<project dir>` which defaults to the current directory (see `pwd()`). 
##  If a project file is specified it is openend and the project dir is derived.  
## 
##  Checks wether the project is consistent and if not acts accordingly. Loads the project and all its dependencies
##  also loads all materialized packages which are not part of the project's dependency graph
## 
## **returns** 
## * `<project handle>` the handle to the current project (contains the `project_descriptor`) 
## 
## **events**
## * `project_on_opening(<project handle>)` emitted when the `<project handle>` exists but nothing is loaded yet
## * `project_on_open(<project handle>)` emitted  so that custom handlers can perform actions like loading, initializing, etc
## * `project_on_opened(<project handle>)` emitted after the project was checked and loaded
## * events have access to the follwowing in their scope: 
##   * `project_dir:<qualified path>` the location of this projects root directory
##   * `project_handle:<project handle>` the handle to the project
